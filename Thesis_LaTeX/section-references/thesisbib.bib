@article{Liu_2010,
	Abstract = {When people make decisions, they usually rely on recommendations from friends and acquaintances. Although collaborative filtering (CF), the most popular recommendation technique, utilizes similar neighbors to generate recommendations, it does not distinguish friends in a neighborhood from strangers who have similar tastes. Because social networking Web sites now make it easy to gather social network information, a study about the use of social network information in making recommendations will probably produce productive results. In this study, we developed a way to increase recommendation effectiveness by incorporating social network information into CF. We collected data about users{\^a}€{\texttrademark} preference ratings and their social network relationships from a social networking Web site. Then, we evaluated \{CF\} performance with diverse neighbor groups combining groups of friends and nearest neighbors. Our results indicated that more accurate prediction algorithms can be produced by incorporating social network information into CF. },

	Abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the field of recommender systems and describes the current generation of recommendation methods that are usually classified into the following three main categories: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendation approaches. This paper also describes various limitations of current recommendation methods and discusses possible extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and make recommender systems applicable to an even broader range of applications. These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multicriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations.},
