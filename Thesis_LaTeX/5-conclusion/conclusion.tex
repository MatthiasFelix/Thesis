\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{c:conclusion} The main contribution of this thesis are the findings discussed in section \ref{st:discussion}. CF and social CF algorithms were analyzed in detail and conditions were found under which social CF outperforms CF and vice versa. The influence of the existence of communities in social networks on recommender algorithms has also been analyzed, revealing that information about the community structure in a network might help to further enhance social CF algorithms.

There are many areas of possible future research. Many of the findings will have to be confirmed by validating them on different real-world datasets. The hypothesis that there exist users for which social CF works better than CF remains to be proven true. Another interesting field of possible future work would be to focus on items rather than users, investigating whether there exist items or groups of items for which social CF works better than others.

Further, with the knowledge gained through this study, new algorithms could be designed that are more customizable and adjustable to the specific environments they operate in. The inclusion of the information about users' centrality could result in an even better social CF algorithm.
